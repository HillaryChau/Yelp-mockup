Tech used: HTML CSS

<img src="/images/yelp.PNG" alt="yelp" style="height: 100px; width:100px;"/>

Lesson Learned:

This is one of my first html css projects. To this project I learned the value of using media queries and also using display: none to hide certain items at different web sizes. For example using a navigation icon to replace a long navigation bar.
